## I'm Marcus Brasizza

A father and a software developer.

I started in this dev world when i had 11 years old. Since that time i knew that i was made to code! In 2004 i started with PHP and it was was love of first sight, and i still develop with php (now with lumen/laravel) 

With this amazing framework flutter i was able to do alot of mobile things.
